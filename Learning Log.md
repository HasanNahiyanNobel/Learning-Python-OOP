Learning from [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc) tutorial.



## 1. Classes and Instances
1. Created a class with `pass`.
1. Created instances of that class and manually added something which I believe should be called class variables.
1. Added `__init__` method to class.
1. Added a method to class. Got a basic understanding of how `self` works.
1. Had a *gooder* understanding of how `self` is actually passed.



## 2. Class Variables
1. Added a class variable and used it in a function of class, only to know that things *doesn't* work like this.
1. Used `self` to access a class variable.
1. Used class name instead of `self` to use a variable like static, as per my understanding.
